    "[`nflgame`](https://pypi.org/project/nflgame/) is an API to retrieve and read NFL Game Center JSON data. It can work with real-time data. `nflgame` works by parsing the same JSON data that powers NFL.com's live GameCenter. The package comes pre-loaded with game data from every pre and regular season game from 2009 to present. Therefore, querying such data does not actually ping NFL.com. "
